# Shopping-Cart

This is a simple shopping cart application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to:

1. Adjust the quantity of each item using "+" and "-" buttons.
2. Delete items from the cart.
3. Like items using a clickable heart-shaped button that changes color accordingly.
4. See the total price adjusted according to the quantity and deletions.
